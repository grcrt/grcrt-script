### IMPORTANT INFO
This script version brings no major updates and contains only a couple of bugfixes. 
We're using an autobuild system for our script, that automatically takes care of proper versioning.
However, when fed with wrong information, it'll release wrong verion number. 
We are sorry if you feel disappointed with that mistake - we'll learn from it :blush:

# [4.0.0](https://github.com/grcrt/grcrt-script/compare/v3.15.3...v4.0.0) (2018-04-16)


### Performance Improvements

* **optimization:** code tweaks ([957de40](https://github.com/grcrt/grcrt-script/commit/957de40))


## NOTICE

We have moved our codebase to GitHub. Everyone who feels like helping developing the script, is mostly welcome to. 
Having the script hosted on GitHub, also makes it easier to gather all bug reports in one place, 
without the need of having to check various forums, facebook, g+ and email accounts.

Do you wanna become a GRCRT co-developer? 

Do you have a bug to report?

**Come see us on GitHub**

### NOTICE

Just like you, we don't like ads on websites. Unfortunately, they're mostly main source of income for the site they're displayed on. 
Because of the fact that we've recently been receiving signals thats our ads are displaying inapropriate content (despite us having that setting disabled) 
and the fact that income was just not sufficient to cover the costst of our infrastructure, we decided to temporarirly disable the ads. As a result, player 
and alliance statistics can now be again displayed in an in-game windows. We're hoping you'll appreciate the work we do, by donating to GRCRTools further 
development and to help us keep our servers running ($200/month)

### NOTICE

Forgive us that in the last versions so few functions have been added.
Unfortunately, we struggle with our server's restricted efficiency. Every new idea may negatively affect its stability.
Sadly, the server change implies additional costs (about â‚¬100 per month). Taking into account the drop in incomes from
ads and donations, we cannot afford the change at the moment.
