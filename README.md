# Script functions
GRCRT is offering a plethora of functions. Below are described the ones most commonly used.

## BBCode Converter
Core function of the script. BBCode conversion makes sharing information just a few mouse clicks away.

### What is it converting?
  - most of the reports (battle reports with revolt being stirred up, will show an additional strategic information about the upstirred city)
  - list of cities on an island
  - list of players in an alliance
  - troops movements
  - individual orders (in case of an incoming attack, also with units shown by "Wisdom" spell)
  - many more...

### Where can the converted information be inserted?
  - in-game messages
  - in-game notes
  - in-game forums
  - external forums

### What if BBcode is not suppoprted?
With GRCRT there is always a way to share a report :relaxed:. For places where BBCodes are not supported, script offers 2 alternative solutions:
  - convert to image
  - URL to an online copy of the report
